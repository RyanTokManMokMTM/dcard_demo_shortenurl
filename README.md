# Dcard Demo
Allowing to access local open apis if server is in **debug mode**
```yaml
Mode: debug
```
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/index.html
```
### Tool in use
* Gin-Gonic(backend framework)
* Mysql database with GORM
* Validator v10 
* Viper
* Swagger-API

### APIs
|Uri|Method|Desc|
|---|---|---|
|/api/v1/urls|POST|Upload Longrest URL with expired date in UTC format|
|/{url_id}|GET|Redirect to original url with url_id|

### How it work
#### Upload url
* Getting uploaded data from the HTTP Form and validating  the data via Validator including URL and time
* Create a new tuple/record to the DB with Form data if data is validated successfully
* After tuple is created, server'll use **base62 Algorithm** to generate the short_URL depending on Unix time
  * base62 Algorithm Implementation
  * Input int64(unix time) and output a string which string consists of a-z, A-Z,and 0-9(total 62 characters) 
  ```go
  //Base62URL in order to generate shorten url string,it's consider to use base 62 approach(6byte)
  func Base62URL(id int64) string {
    if id < 0 {
      return ""
    }
    //[a-z,A-Z,0-9]
    urlStr := "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" //total 62 character
    url := ""

    for {
      if id <= 0 {
        break
      }
      str := urlStr[int(id%62)]
      url += string(str)
      id = id / 62
    }
    return url
  }
  ```
* After the short_URL is generated by the algorithm, the short_URL will be updated in DB

#### Redirect to orignal url
* Getting short url id from url path, for example: the short url_id is `abc123`
* We'll query the database and check the url_id(Checking steps below)
  * Step 1 :whether the url_id exist
    * 1.the url_id **not exist**,return *404 Not Found* Immediately
    * 2.the url_id **exist** in the database,it goes to the next step
  * Step 2 :whether the url_id expire
    * 1.the url_id expired, return *404 Not Found* Immediately
    * 2.the url_id does not expire, reirect to the orginal_url
